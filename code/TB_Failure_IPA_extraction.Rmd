## Import and use Ingenuity IPA enrichment data

This document describes steps recommended for using Ingenuity IPA
enrichment data.

Ingenuity IPA enrichment data can be exported using a function
`"Export All"` which by default creates one text file, concatenating
each enrichment table into one large file.

This workflow demonstrates the import process using two IPA enrichment
files used by Reese et al 2019
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2018.11.043> to compare enrichment
results in newborns to older children.

It therefore requires IPA enrichment results have already been exported
in text format from IPA.

### Import IPA data from text files

To import an IPA text file, use `importIPAenrichment()`:


For MultiEnrichMap, we typically want to analyze multiple IPA enrichment
files, so we can wrap the call in an `lapply()` function:

```{r, import_ipa_1_2}
# newborn_txt <- system.file("extdata",
#    "Newborns-IPA.txt",
#    package="multienrichjam");
# olderchildren_txt <- system.file("extdata",
#    "OlderChildren-IPA.txt",
#    package="multienrichjam");
# ipa_files <- c(Newborns=newborn_txt,
#    OlderChildren=olderchildren_txt)
# outs <- lapply(ipa_files, importIPAenrichment);
```

Now we can check the dimensions within each list using `jamba::ssdim()`:

```{r, ipa_ssdim}
ssdim(outs);
```

In most cases, each IPA file should contain the same enrichment tests,
for example `"Canonical Pathways"`, `"Upstream Regulators"`,
`"Diseases and Bio Functions"`, etc. However, it is not always the case,
so it is recommended to check and verify each IPA file contains at least
the enrichment tests needed for downstream analysis.

## Analyze IPA enrichments from one enrichment test

IPA performs multiple enrichment tests, which are done independently and
with unique assumptions and caveats. Therefore, I recommend using one
enrichment test at a time in MultiEnrichMap.

Extract one `data.frame` from each result:

```{r, extract_canonical}
library(igraph)
## Take only the Ingenuity Canonical Pathways
enrichList_canonical <- lapply(outs, function(i){
   i[["Canonical Pathways"]];
});
sdim(enrichList_canonical);
## Convert data.frame to enrichResult
## multienrichjam::enrichDF2enrichResult
er_canonical <- lapply(enrichList_canonical, function(i){
   enrichDF2enrichResult(i,
      keyColname="Name",
      pvalueColname="P-value",
      geneColname="geneNames",
      geneRatioColname="Ratio",
      pvalueCutoff=1)
});
sdim(er_canonical);
kable_coloring(
   head(as.data.frame(er_canonical[[1]])),
   caption="Top 10 rows of enrichment data",
   row.names=FALSE) %>%
   kableExtra::column_spec(column=seq_len(ncol(er_canonical[[1]])),
      border_left="1px solid #DDDDDD",
      extra_css="white-space: nowrap;")
```

### run multiEnrichMap()

Now given a list of `data.frame` results, we can run `multiEnrichMap()`:

```{r, mem_canonical, fig.height=9, fig.width=10}
mem_canonical <- multiEnrichMap(er_canonical,
   enrichBaseline=1,
   cutoffRowMinP=0.05,
   colorV=c("purple", "orange"),
   topEnrichN=20)
```

The output `mem_canonical` is a list containing various results.

```{r, mem_sdim}
kable_coloring(
   sdim(mem_canonical),
   caption="sdim(mem_canonical)") %>%
   kableExtra::column_spec(column=seq_len(4),
      border_left="1px solid #DDDDDD",
      extra_css="white-space: nowrap;")
```

### Create a "Mem Plot Folio" (new Apr2020)

The other analysis steps describe in this vignette are valid options,
however in recent work with `multienrichjam` we have developed a new
function to create a small folio of relates plots that we call a "mem
plot folio", and the function is `mem_plot_folio()`.

The `mem_plot_folio()` function creates the following plots by default:

1.  Enrichment P-value heatmap (optionally colored by group)

2.  Gene-pathway incidence matrix, clustered by column and by row

3.  Cnet plot including all collapsed pathway clusters

    -   The first plot labels clusters by `LETTERS`, "A", "B", "C", "D",
        etc.
    -   The second plot labels clusters by the top `n` pathway names
    -   The third plot labels clusters by the top `n` pathway names, but
        hides gene labels. This plot is best when there are too many
        genes to label.

4.  Cnet plot using 1,2,3 exemplars per pathway cluster (configurable)

    -   The first plot uses 1 exemplar per cluster.
    -   The second plot uses 2 exemplars per cluster.
    -   The third plot uses 3 exemplars per cluster.

5.  Cnet plot of each pathway cluster individually

    -   The number of plots is the number of heatmap pathway_clusters.

```{r, mem_folio, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
mem_canonical_plots <- multienrichjam::mem_plot_folio(mem_canonical,
   pathway_column_split=4,
   node_factor=1,
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   label_factor=1.2,
   do_which=c(1:5),
   verbose=F,
   main="Canonical Pathways");
```

The object returned `mem_canonical_plots` will contain a list of the
graphical objects for each plot requested. For example, each Cnet plot
returns an `igraph` object which can be customized.

#### Commentary on the "Plot Folio"

In practice, we rarely found much benefit from the multi-enrichment map,
which shows pathways connected to pathways based upon Jaccard overlap.
This network view was often disorganized, not clearly clustered, and
lacked ability to see which genes drive the overlaps between pathways.
Perhaps it works best for the highly structured Gene Ontology (GO), but
in our hands GO was just not insightful for the broad range of
experiments we were analyzing.

Instead, we almost always gravitated toward the Cnet plot, a clever idea
by Dr. Guangchang Yu that connects pathways to genes, where genes also
connect naturally to other pathways. This plot for many of our
collaborators has seemed more intuitive, and answers the next question
people often have: "What are the shared genes?" Our subtle addition to
this plot is to color-code genes by the enrichment experiment, so you
can see which genes are shared or unique by experiment.

Since most enrichment results have far more pathways than can be shown
in one Cnet plot, we tried to prioritize which pathways to display. The
logic in Dr. Yu's `enrichplot` is to take the top `n` pathways by
P-value, however we noticed for our data this logic often shows
redundant pathways and misses orthologous biological functions, which
might be enriched to a lesser degree. So we started clustering pathways
by P-value, then by using the pathway-gene incidence matrix.

The pathway-gene incidence matrix worked best in our hands for this
clustering, partly because it clusters pathways by the genes involved,
and not by the pattern of enrichment across the enrichment tests (which
may not be related to the underlying genes.) So we cluster pathways,
then choose an arbitrary number of clusters, and took one "exemplar"
from each cluster to represent each cluster. This practice is mostly
effective, especially when the clusters are well-defined, and when
members of each cluster have relatively similar function. We can
increase the exemplars per cluster as needed. This strategy is helpful
because each pathway is very clearly labeled.

Most recently, we experimented with collapsing each pathway_cluster, so
each pathway_cluster includes all genes implicated by pathways contained
in the pathway_cluster. The benefit here is that no genes are lost by
selecting a subset of "exemplar" pathways -- all genes are retained per
cluster. Then instead of plotting pathway-gene network, we plot a
pathway_cluster-gene network. Each pathway_cluster is labeled using the
top `n` pathway names -- which is configurable, and is only a visible
label. Each pathway_cluster contains all the pathways in the cluster.

### Directly create each individual plot

The plots in `mem_plot_folio()` are also available as individual
functions.

In general, it is most convenient to call `mem_plot_folio()` and use the
output `list` to create custom plots, however the functions are also
available to be called independently.

#### Plot the MultiEnrichMap network

We can view the "Multi Enrichment Map" itself with
`mem_multienrichplot()`.

This network connects pathways when they meet a Jaccard overlap
coefficient threshold based upon the shared genes between the pathways.
The default overlap is stored by `multiEnrichMap()` in the output object
`mem_canonical`.

```{r, mem_plot_1}
g <- mem_multienrichplot(mem_canonical,
   do_plot=FALSE,
   overlap=0.3,
   node_factor=2,
   repulse=3.5)
jam_igraph(g,
   node_factor=2,
   use_shadowText=TRUE)
```

The overlap threshold can be customized manually, or through the helper
function `mem_find_overlap()`. This function attempts to guess a
reasonable overlap threshold based upon the network connectivity, by
optimizing the cluster size and total nodes involved.

```{r, mem_plot_1b}
g <- mem_multienrichplot(mem_canonical,
   overlap=mem_find_overlap(mem_canonical),
   do_plot=FALSE,
   node_factor=3,
   repulse=3.5)
jam_igraph(g,
   node_factor=3,
   use_shadowText=TRUE)
```

Notice there are distinct subnetworks, called "components", which are
not connected to each other. A useful follow-up technique is to graph
one component at a time, which we do using the helper function
`subset_igraph_components()`. Components are ordered by size, largest to
smallest, so you can keep the largest using argument `keep=1`, or the
second largest with `keep=2`, and so on.

We also call two other helper functions:

1.  `removeIgraphBlanks()` removes blank colors from multi-color nodes,
    such as pie nodes, or colored rectangle nodes. It helps show only
    the remaining colors without the whitespace.
2.  `relayout_with_qfr()` applies Fruchterman-Reingold layout to an
    `igraph` object. It's convenient to adjust `repulse` here, which is
    the recommended method for adjusting the spacing between nodes. This
    function also updates other useful attributes such as the node label
    angle, which makes labels appear offset away from the majority of
    edges. (It helps more with Cnet plots below.)

```{r, mem_plot_2}
## You can alternatively pull out any other component
g_sub <- subset_igraph_components(g, keep=1);
## Re-apply network layout, and remove blank colors
g_sub <- relayout_with_qfr(repulse=3.5,
   removeIgraphBlanks(g_sub))
## Plot
jam_igraph(g_sub,
   node_factor=3,
   use_shadowText=TRUE)
```

#### Plot the enrichment P-value matrix

A useful overview of the enrichment results, including the overlaps
across datasets, is shown in a heatmap of `-log10(Pvalue)`. The helper
function `mem_enrichment_heatmap()` is used here.

The argument `p_cutoff` is used to set the Pvalue below which cells are
colorized -- every P-value above this threshold is not colored, and
displayed as white, even when the P-value is less than 1.

```{r, enrich_hm, show.warnings=FALSE}
# png(file="compare_genes_from_genesets_bubbleplot.png")
#   g <- mem_enrichment_heatmap(mem_canonical,
#    p_cutoff=0.05, column_fontsize = 6);
#  draw(g)
#  dev.off()
#  
 
png("compare_genes_from_genesets_bubbleplot.png", width=7, height=7, pointsize=6, units="in", res=300)
mem_enrichment_heatmap(mem_canonical,
   p_cutoff=0.05);
dev.off()
#ggsave("compare_genes_from_genesets_bubbleplot.png", plot=g, device="png")
```

The same data can be plotted as a heatmap.

```{r, enrich_hm_1}
mem_enrichment_heatmap(mem_canonical,
   style="heatmap",
   p_cutoff=0.05);
```

The argument `color_by_column=TRUE` will optionally apply a color
gradient to each column, using the same P-value threshold defined by
`p_cutoff`. In this case, cells are labeled to indicate the actual
enrichment P-value.

```{r, enrich_hm_2}
mem_enrichment_heatmap(mem_canonical,
   style="heatmap",
   color_by_column=TRUE);
```

#### Plot the pathway-gene incidence matrix

We can view the pathway-gene matrix using the function
`mem_gene_path_heatmap()`. This function uses data in the `mem` object:
`"memIM"` which contains the gene-pathway incidence matrix, `"geneIM"`
which contains the gene-dataset incidence matrix, and `"enrichIM"` which
contains the pathway-dataset matrix.

This function attempts to "guess" a reasonable number of column and row
splits -- which breaks the column and row dendrograms into separate
sub-clusters. These breaks are visual only, but can be useful in
follow-up analyses shown later. You can override these numbers with
arguments `column_split` and `row_split`.

Also, the colors used across the top of the heatmap indicate the
enrichment P-value, and are intentionally scaled so all P-values above
the P-value threshold are not colored, and are therefore white.

This function uses the amazing `ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()` function,
which enables many awesome customizable features. The `...` argument is
passed to `ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`, so you can use those features as
needed.

```{r, mem_hm}
hm <- mem_gene_path_heatmap(mem_canonical,
   column_cex=0.5,
   row_cex=0.6);
hm;
```

As a follow-up analysis, you can pull out each pathway cluster from the
heatmap itself, using `heatmap_column_order()`:

```{r, mem_hm_sets}
hm_sets <- heatmap_column_order(hm);
hm_sets;
```

### Plot the Pathway-Gene Concept network (Cnet plot)

We can view the Cnet plot (concept network plot) which shows the
pathway-gene relationship.

The helper function `memIM2cnet()` creates a Cnet plot from the
`mem_canonical` output. Here, we also pipe the result through other
helper functions:

-   `fixSetLabels()` applies pathway label word wrap
-   `relayout_with_qfr()` applies network layout and adjusts node labels
-   `removeIgraphBlanks()` removes blank colors from the `igraph` nodes

```{r, cnet_plot_1}
#cnet <- mem_canonical$multiCnetPlot1b;
cnet <- mem_canonical %>% 
   memIM2cnet() %>%
   fixSetLabels() %>%
   removeIgraphBlanks() %>%
   relayout_with_qfr(repulse=4);
#plot(cnet, vertex.label.cex=0.6);
par("mar"=c(5,4,4,2)+0.1)
jam_igraph(cnet,
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   node_factor=0.5,
   vertex.label.cex=0.6);
mem_legend(mem_canonical);
```

You can extract the largest connected subnetwork to plot, as before.

```{r, cnet_plot_2}
g2 <- cnet;
g2_sub <- subset_igraph_components(cnet, keep=1)
#plot(g2_sub);
jam_igraph(g2_sub,
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   label_factor=0.5,
   node_factor=0.5);
```

#### Customizing the Cnet plot

The most useful customization is to subset the pathway nodes.

One useful method to choose a subset of pathways is to view one heatmap
cluster at a time. Here we will use `hm_sets` made previously.

```{r, cnet_plot_1_custom}
cnet_sub <- subsetCnetIgraph(cnet,
   repulse=3.5,
   includeSets=unlist(hm_sets[c("A")]));
jam_igraph(cnet_sub,
   node_factor=1,
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   label_dist_factor=3,
   label_factor=1.3);
mem_legend(mem_canonical);
```

#### Subset the Pathway-Gene Cnet plot

You can also subset the Pathway-Gene Cnet plot using specific names, or
by some network criteria, using the function `subsetCnetIgraph()`.

Pathways are subsetted to require at least 6 genes, using the argument
`minSetDegree`, which can be useful to help simplify the graph
structure.

Similarly, the `minGeneDegree=2` argument can be used to display only
genes present in 2 or more pathways, but for now we will not use that
argument.

During the subset operation, some convenient default operations are also
performed, controlled by function arguments:

-   singlet nodes (with no connection to any other) are removed,
    `remove_singlets=TRUE`
-   the layout is re-calculated, `force_relayout=TRUE`
-   nodes are re-ordered by color, `do_reorder=TRUE`
-   labels are re-positioned to have proper angle offset away from the
    edges entering each node, `spread_labels=TRUE`
-   blank colors are not removed from pie and colored rectangle nodes,
    `remove_blanks=FALSE`, but can be during this step by
    `remove_blanks=TRUE`.

```{r, subnet, fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
cnet3 <- multienrichjam::subsetCnetIgraph(cnet,
   repulse=5,
   minSetDegree=6,
   minGeneDegree=1);
jam_igraph(cnet3,
   node_factor=0.7,
   use_shadowText=TRUE);
mem_legend(mem_canonical);
```

#### Custom igraph plot function jam_igraph()

The `jam_igraph()` function is a custom version of `igraph::plot()`
intended to enhance the base function in a few ways:

-   `edge_bundling="connections"` improves the rendering of edges by
    bundling edges from node clusters, so they are drawn with a bezier
    curve

-   `use_shadowText=TRUE` will draw labels with a contrasting border to
    improve legibility of text labels

-   `rescale=FALSE` keeps the network layout aspect ratio instead of
    scaling the coordinates to fit the size of the plot window. It also
    properly scales the node and edge sizes.

-   new arguments to help resize existing values:

    -   `label_factor` re-scales the `label.cex` values by a multiplier
    -   `node_factor`, `edge_factor` re-scales the `node.size` and
        `edge.width` by a multiplier
    -   `label_dist_factor` re-scales the `label.dist` values by a
        multiplier

The function below replicates the previous Cnet plot, with these
changes:

-   `node_factor=2` makes the nodes 2x larger
-   `label_factor=1.2` makes the `label.cex` values 1.2x larger
-   `label_dist_factor=3` makes the label distance from the node center
    3x larger, which emphasizes the label placement at an angle away
    from the edges of each node.

```{r, jam_igraph_1, fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
jam_igraph(cnet3,
   edge_factor=2,
   node_factor=1.2,
   label_factor=1.2, 
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   label_dist_factor=3);
```

One more fancy alternative, you can colorize the edges based upon the
node colors, a great idea inspired by the Gephi netowrk visualization
tool.

```{r, jam_igraph_2, fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
jam_igraph(color_edges_by_nodes(cnet3, alpha=0.7),
   edge_bundling="connections",
   edge_factor=2,
   node_factor=1,
   label_factor=1.2, 
   use_shadowText=TRUE,
   label_dist_factor=3)
```
